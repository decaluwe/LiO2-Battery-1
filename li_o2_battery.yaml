  Cantera input file for a lithium-O2/lithium-Air battery

  This file includes a full set of thermodynamic and kinetic parameters of a
  lithium-oxygen battery, in particular:
  - Active materials: Li metal (anode) and Li2O2 (cathode)
  - Conductive cathode host material: solid carbon
  - Organic electrolyte: EC/PC with 1M LiPF6 (currently. Eventually we will implement a more relevant electrolyte: 1M LiTFSI in TEGDME).
  - Interfaces: cabon/electrolyte, Li2O2/electrolyte, and LiC6/electrolyte
  - Charge-transfer reactions at the Li/electrolyte interface and the carbon/Li2O2/electrolyte interface region.
